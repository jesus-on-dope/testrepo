tha raw idea:
create a new usser interface like shruthi XT as a universal Control Surface:
- Midi Ports in and out
- controls for a number of oscillators (4?)
- controls for filter
- controls for envelopes
- (Touch)-Display for Mod-Matrix and additional settings


create a new digital board based on arduino due, check if the dacs work (i.e. sound good) as audio outputs
create an adapter board/pinout to use  shruthi 1 filter boards 

migrate shruthi sourcecode to arduino due
design an PC editor / VST right from the start

raw Idea 2:
create a midi controller to modify note verlocity like an audio mixer
